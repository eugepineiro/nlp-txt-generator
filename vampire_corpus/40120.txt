THE VAMPIRE CAT


SCENE. _At R. is a dressing table, upon it a steel mirror, toilet
articles, and two lighted candles with ornate shades. R. U. a section of
shoji leads to another room, this section is now closed. At R. C. a
large section of shoji is open, giving a view of the garden. To the R.
of this entrance is a small shrine and Buddha. At L. of the room is a
sleeping mat and head rest. By the head rest a lantern, now unlighted.
Down L. is an open section of shoji leading to the_ PRINCE'S
_apartments. Just above it stands a screen. As the curtain rises the_
PRINCE _is standing R. C. looking out into the garden._ RUITEN _is down
R. and_ BUZEN _slightly above him._ BUZEN _crosses L._


  PRINCE. [_Comes down between_ RUITEN _and_ BUZEN.]
  Settle for me tonight
  My sicknesses and my fears--
  [_To_ BUZEN.] Settle them for me,
  Sir Buzen, councillor crafty.
  [_To_ RUITEN.] Settle them for me,
  Priest Ruiten, the prayerful.

  RUITEN. So are we trying in all ways
  Thy pain to relieve
  Yet nought seems availing.

  PRINCE. Wracked is my body
  With tortures unending
  Born of the dreams
  That are surging forever
  Backward and forward
  Thru my brain, weary.

  BUZEN. [_Indicating door L._] Around thy bed each night
  Have I placed thy samurai
  In number one hundred
  To guard thy sleep--

  RUITEN. Zealously have I prayed
  In the temple called "Miyo In,"
  And during the night hours
  Have knelt at thy house shrine
  Praying to Buddha, the lord of the world.

  PRINCE. Yet have I not slept
  Entirely untortured.
  Slow are thy prayers
  In fruit bearing.

  RUITEN. Slow because contending with evil--
                [_Approaches Prince._]
  With evil in form strange and subtle.
  Over this house hangs a spirit
  Ne'er resting and ready always for dire deeds.

  PRINCE. Such a spirit there must be--but what?

  RUITEN. Evil takes many forms but the form of a cat
  Is favored by many devils.

  PRINCE. [_Startled, the others watch him closely._] A cat--aye, truly
  And if a cat stalked here
  That evil thing must we kill.

  RUITEN. Yet such is their power malignant
  That they take other forms than the forms of cats--
  Even human forms.

  PRINCE. Ha!--And the spirit that visits me?
  Mayhap that--
  Only twice hath it failed of its visit.

  BUZEN. And those lost visits, when?

  PRINCE. The last two nights.

  BUZEN. [_Swelling with pride._] Then, oh Prince, the cure may
    be found.
  Better than prayers is the cure [_Eyeing_ RUITEN.]
  For prayers have not ears--have not eyes--
  Have not weapons--better than prayers is it.

  PRINCE. Tell me this cure. It is grudged, Sir Priest?

  RUITEN. [_Bowing._] A cure for my lord could not be grudged.

  PRINCE. Well spoken. Say on, Sir Buzen.

  BUZEN. First I must beg clemency
  For thy hundred samurai
  For faithful they are to the bone, yet--

  PRINCE. Yet? Why clemency? For what?

  BUZEN. On guard, they slept.

  PRINCE. Slept?

  BUZEN. Aye. Soundly as though deep in saki.

  PRINCE. And none roused?

  BUZEN. They were as dead
  From shortly after the hour of ten
  Until dawning.
  Awakening they knew they had slept
  Yet knew not when the poppy was thrown in their eyes.
  Even as one man none knew
  And were deep amazed and full of shame.
  Each night it was the same.

  PRINCE. [_Angrily._] So, they slept.
  While I, on my couch,
  Through the hours writhed--
  Writhed and twisted--
  Weakening ever--
  Not sleep, yet dreaming--
  Oh, horrible dreams.

  RUITEN. Of what were these horrible dreams?
  What was their substance?

  PRINCE. [_Mystified at the memory._] There would come a soft
    stealing--
  As of draperies hushed and lifted
  For silence in walking;
  Like soft, silken draperies
  Wrapped about stealthy limbs.
  Then a shape clothed for sleep
  As women are clothed--
  Sinuous and vague in movement,
  Then taking form slowly--
  The form--a lie!--a lie! [_Covers his face and goes upstage._]

  RUITEN. The form?

  PRINCE. [_Turns._] O Toyo!

  RUITEN.
  BUZEN. [_Rubbing their hands._] Ah!

  PRINCE. [_Comes down R._, RUITEN _and_ BUZEN _are together a
    little L._]
  Came she to me--
  Leaned o'er me--
  Caressed me
  Yet soothed not.
  Her lips to mine--
  Her lips but not sweet.
  Then here on my throat
  Would she place them
  And all my life seemed to smother--
  Out of me flowed the life-blood
  In a deep stream
  Like a tide
  Forced by the gods,
  Against its will,
  To flow far away and yet farther.

  BUZEN. So does a vampire
  Sucking her victim
  Draw from him
  His blood and his marrow.

  PRINCE. Guard thy words!--
  As my strength ebbed
  She drew back
  Red-lipped and smiling,
  Smiling and laughing
  Though her laughter was silent.
  Then with a final shimmer
  Of silent silks she vanished--
  So was it done.

  RUITEN. So always the dream?
  If dream it were.

  PRINCE. The dream--I think yet it was a dream--
  So was it always.

  BUZEN. But the last two nights?

  PRINCE. Came she as usual
  Flowing over the floor
  Like a spectre enrobed
  And beautified.
  But as she bent o'er me
  She paused as if startled
  And, slowly gazing about,
  Turned and was gone.
  Last night she paused
  As if speaking to someone
  Though I could see no one.

  BUZEN. But the cause of her turning?

  RUITEN. Turned she startled--
  Turned she slowly--
  Turned she wonderingly?

  PRINCE. Slowly, as if she felt
  A strange presence.

  RUITEN. Feared she?

  PRINCE. She left me.

  BUZEN. But trembling or calm?

  PRINCE. Calmly, as from a thing hated
  And more powerful than she
  Whom she would not rouse to action.

  BUZEN. [_Rubbing his hands._] Good.

  PRINCE. What is good?

  BUZEN. That which thou speakest of.

  PRINCE. How so?

  BUZEN. [_Comes forward towards the Prince._] It proves that I have
    humbly succeeded--
  [_Grudgingly._] Through the help of another, 'tis true--
  But yet succeeded in bringing my lord honorable help.

  RUITEN. Indeed it is so.

  PRINCE. Say on, very wise councillor.

  BUZEN. [_Puffing up._] Without more words than are fit
  This then is the way of the cure.
  When long had thine illness ravaged and worn thee
  And many nights had you tossed by weird visions enthralled,
  No cures affecting, no prayers availing thee [_Glances at_ RUITEN.]
  Then councilled I with thy wise ones--
  And, too, with Priest Ruiten--

  RUITEN. I, you should name first,
  For without my prayers your wisdom was nought.

  BUZEN. To continue briefly.
  All our heads together brought no solution--

  PRINCE. True, true.

  BUZEN. [_Bowing._] Humbly I acknowledge my head
  Empty and brainless.
  Yet even from idiots lips
  Wisdom oft falls unexpected
  And therefore more wonderful.
  Now it is told in old tales
  Of how Iyaiyasu met--

  RUITEN. Short, abrupt is thy tale.

  PRINCE. The cure, Sir Buzen,
  The hour passes.

  BUZEN. [_Bowing._] I crave honorable leniency.
  To be brief--

  PRINCE. Aye, brief.

  BUZEN. Discouraged and sick at heart
  At the sufferings of my great lord,
  I was retiring to my room
  By way of the garden
  And the hour was the Hour of the Fox.
  I heard a splashing in the pool
  And drawing near
  Saw a young soldier washing.
  I spoke to him asking,
  "Who art thou?"
  "Retainer to my Lord Nabeshima,
  Prince of Hizen," he answered.
  Then talked I with him. Of thy sickness
  We talked. And he was ashamed of thy samurai's sleeping.
  He begged to be allowed to guard thy sleep
  Also for, being a common soldier, it was not permitted.
  So earnestly talked he that I promised to consult
  With the other councillors and see what could be done.
  "So tell me your name, young sir," I said.
  "Ito Soda is my name, honorable sir,
  And for your kind words I thank you."
  So I consulted and the result was
  We granted his request.

  PRINCE. And he, too, has watched the two nights past?

  RUITEN. Aye, and he slept not
  Though the samurai were heavy with sleep-fumes.

  BUZEN. I will tell.

  RUITEN. [_Elbows_ BUZEN _out of the way and comes forward._] You
    are honorably hoarse.
  He slept not, as I say--

  PRINCE. How kept he awake?
  Since many slept spell-bound
  How broke he the spell?

  RUITEN. With him he brought
  Oiled paper and laid it
  Down on the matting
  Sitting upon it.
  When o'er his eyes sleep stole
  And wearily weighted them
  He drew out his sharp dirk
  And in his thigh thrust it
  By pain driving the poppy fumes off.
  Ever and again he twisted
  The dirk in the raw wound
  And the thick blood-drops
  Soiled not the matting
  Because of the oiled paper.

  PRINCE. Indeed this is no common soldier,
  This Ito Soda.

  BUZEN. Indeed not--

  RUITEN. To continue--[_Retires upstage, disgruntled._]

  BUZEN. [_Pushing forward._] As I was saying, oh Prince,
  His eyes never closed.
  During the Reign of the Rat
  He heard, in this room, O Toyo
  Tossing and moaning
  As if in great fear of something
  She could not escape from.
  Even at the same moment
  As the beginnings of her moanings
  Came a cat-call from the garden--
  Then nearer--then ghostly paddings
  As of padded claws on matting,
  And an evil presence seemed hovering
  And lurking near in the darkness.
  O Toyo gave a low scream--than all was silence.
  Soon she came stealthily
  Through the shoji--cat-like her step--
  Glassy her eyes--
  Claw-like her hands--
  Bent she over you with curled lips--
  Then she turned, even as you have said,
  And, seeing a waking watcher,
  Left as she came.

  RUITEN. [_Comes down._] The second night of Ito Soda's watching
  She threatened him in low words
  But he made as to stab her
  And she melted before him
  Laughing a little.
  And he heard the rustle of her garments
  As she regained this room
  Though he saw not her passage hither.

  PRINCE. Thicker with each word the horror about me.
  [_Turns away to R._] Doubts to beliefs--beliefs to actions--
  Love unto hate. [_Turns to them almost pleadingly._]
  Tell me it is not O Toyo.

  BUZEN. I questioned her maid, Kashiku,
  And found that O Toyo's couch
  Was empty even at the time
  Of the weird visit to thee.

  PRINCE. [_Overwhelmed._] So, it was O Toyo!
  In the soul of a flower, a demon--
  On the sweet lips, poison.

  BUZEN. There is only one course--

  RUITEN. The one road--

  PRINCE. And I take it!

  BUZEN. [_Moves toward door L._] The samurai are gathered.

  PRINCE. Summon Ito Soda. [BUZEN _exits L._]

  RUITEN. Hard is the fate of man
  Here on this dark earth.
  Many the shapes and the shadows
  Stalking abroad.
  Yet ever the gentle Buddha
  From the Lotus Fields watches
  And guards every life that lives.

  PRINCE. [_Puts one hand on_ RUITEN'S _shoulder._] Priest, have
    not many
  Vampires bleeding them
  And dream it is another thing?

  RUITEN. The soul is often a vampire to the body.

  PRINCE. And that evil thing must we kill.

  ITO SODA. [_Enters L., kneels before the_ PRINCE. RUITEN _takes up
    R. a little and_ BUZEN _re-entering after_ ITO SODA _goes up C._]
  Honorable Prince, humbly I answer thy summons.

  PRINCE. Rise, Ito Soda.
  Faithful beyond words art thou,
  This know I as all hath been told me.
  No longer call thyself a common soldier
  But a samurai of the Prince of Hizen.
  And the two swords will I give thee on the morrow.

  ITO SODA. On my knees I humbly thank thee. [_Rises._]

  PRINCE. Now time presses.
  O Toyo will be coming
  In from the garden.
  As usual shall the hundred sleepy samurai
  Guard my couch. Let Ito Soda
  Remain here hidden and watchful.
  When O Toyo rises to enter my chamber--
  Your dirk is sharp, Ito Soda?

  ITO SODA. [_Draws dirk._] As a moonbeam on a cold night.

  PRINCE. And you know how to use it.

  ITO SODA. I will place this screen, thus. [_Goes to screen L.
    and opens it so as to form a hiding place between the sleeping
    mat and the door L._]
  So will I wait the moment.

  PRINCE. So be it. It is a good plan
  And on the one road. Let us about it. [_Exits L. followed
    by_ BUZEN _and_ RUITEN. ITO SODA _goes behind the screen._
    O TOYO _is heard singing in the garden._]

  O TOYO. [_Outside._] Moonlit convulvus
  Through the night hours
  Wan are their faces
  Ghostly sweet.

  Richer by daylight
  Drinking of sunshine
  As thirsty souls drink
  At a shrine.

  Fair are the faces
  Glassed in the quiet pools
  Maidens low-bending
  Vain ones.

  [_The singing stops abruptly._] Kashiku, is not that a cat
  Stealing stealthily there?
  She snarls--quick--[O TOYO _enters B. C. quickly and very
    frightened, turns and looks back, hurries_ KASHIKU _in._
    KASHIKU _follows much less disturbed at any fear of a cat
    than over her mistress' fright._]

  KASHIKU. [_Shuts the shoji R. C. and comes to_ O TOYO.] You are
    all atremble.

  O TOYO. Quick, let me be safe in slumber. [_Crosses to dressing
    table._]

  KASHIKU. [_Follows her and attends to her hair while_ O TOYO
    _kneels before the glass._] Several nights lately have I
    heard my lady moaning
  As though even in sleep were she troubled.
  The worry over your honorable lord hath disturbed thee.

  O TOYO. Your ears are over keen.
  I am happy when I sleep.
  How can I moan, being happy?
  You are dull.

  KASHIKU. Perhaps it was the wind or the echo of my lord's moaning.

  O TOYO. Moaning or was it singing?
  I would it were singing
  For singing is sweeter
  On the lips of those dying.

  KASHIKU. Dying?

  O TOYO. When those whom we love are passing--
  Even under our hands are passing--
  And our love weans them from life
  And our kisses suck out the blood-life,
  Then would we touch them no more,
  Then would we kiss them no more,
  But a power greater than we
  And a power that we fear
  Forces us on in our love-killing.

  KASHIKU. There is in your voice a vibration, as even the winds in
    the pine-tops
  When, in the autumn, they echo the summer's death-song;
  There is in your eyes a strange light as if the soul of another
  Looked out from your curtaining lashes and dimmed the sweet light
    there abiding.
  Oh, mistress, surely you are different than what you once were.

  O TOYO. [_Crosses C. slowly._] Even now comes the hour and the
    struggle
  And I do the bidding of that which is in me.
  How I hate the feel of his flesh
  Quivering under my lips
  And the loathsome taste of the blood-drops
  Thick on my lips that would soothe him and cannot.

  KASHIKU. Can anything soothe more than thy lips,
  More than the lips that love him?
  I cannot understand the words of your saying.
  You are happy and tearful all in a moment,
  Your soul seems a sky full of sunshine and clouds.
  [_Coming to her._] Even now as my hand touches you, you are
    trembling.
  Is it the cat that crept upon us
  Whose shape still affrights you?

  O TOYO. Thou hast said it--My soul is as thou sayest.
  My dreams are sweet and again bitter.
  Once came a dream horrible above all dreams.

  KASHIKU. What dream, my lady?

  O TOYO. The night when you found me there on the floor.
  Do you remember?

  KASHIKU. Well. You were all distraught and the bosom of your gown
  Was torn open and you clutched your throat
  As if you were wounded there. But there was no mark.
  And you let wild words fall from your lips
  And none knew their meaning.

  O TOYO. The Prince and I walked in the garden
  And there at the shoji I left him.
  As I entered
  There entered
  With me a spirit
  And its breath fell upon me--
  Dumb my tongue in my mouth
  And frozen my marrow.
  Suddenly it leapt upon me
  And as I fell downward
  Flashed the spirit into mine eyes--
  A cat, two-tailed and hairy--
  And it's teeth sank in my throat here--
  Can you see a mark? [_Exposes her throat to_ KASHIKU.]

  KASHIKU. The skin is as smooth as satin and perfect.

  O TOYO. Then came darkness upon me--and so you found me.
  So strong is the dream within me
  I wonder if it be a dream or no.

  KASHIKU. You had walked that evening in the garden.

  O TOYO. I had rather dreamed I walked--say I dreamed it.

  KASHIKU. The Prince was with--

  O TOYO. Yet it was a dream, question it not.
  I would go to rest peacefully.
  He, too, shall rest peacefully--
  I shall not kiss my lord tonight. [_Crosses L._]

  KASHIKU. Not kiss him?

  O TOYO. I think not I shall kiss him.
  I would not pain his slumbers--
  He has paled so and his face is so thin.
  In the night he lies like a strong flower
  And a strange flower, bled of its life--
  Like a strong flower weakened.
  And at its sight my dreams are bitter.
  But as I gaze a change comes over all things
  And I hold in my hands a beautiful flower
  Which I kiss with my lips
  Holding my lips long to it,
  Draining its sweetness.
  And a cloud passes over
  And on my lips are clots of blood!

  KASHIKU. Such dreamings are not good.
  I find the silken coverlets tossed in the morning,
  Twisted and thrown about as if you slept ill.

  O TOYO. It is not O Toyo who tosses them--
  It is the dream O Toyo.

  KASHIKU. Two nights lately have I imagined you called to me
  But entering you were not here--but there with your lord soothing
    his sufferings.

  O TOYO. Drinking at strange fountains and unknown springs--
  Drinking of sacred waters sacred to unknown gods.
  And as I drink another life becomes my life
  And he is mine--utterly mine, at last!

  KASHIKU. You frighten me--

  O TOYO. Be not frightened--you have no need.
  Now I shall sleep.
  He, too, is sleeping. Perhaps--perhaps he is suffering.
  Shall I touch him with my hands?
  Perhaps he is hungry for my kisses--
  Shall I kiss him?

  KASHIKU. It were a fitting thing to kiss thy lord.

  O TOYO. You know not what you say, Kashiku.

  KASHIKU. My lady--

  O TOYO. You have not heard me say strange things, Kashiku.

  KASHIKU. I have heard--

  O TOYO. Nothing.

  KASHIKU. Nothing, my lady.

  O TOYO. Put out the lamps. [KASHIKU _blows out candles on
    dressing table_.]
  Go now, Kashiku, and do you sleep deeply,
  Breathing poppies.

  KASHIKU. My lady--

  O TOYO. Go. [KASHIKU _opens shoji R. and goes out shutting it
    after her_. O TOYO _crosses, too, and lies on the sleeping
    mat. The room is almost in total darkness._]

  O TOYO. I shall kiss him--I shall kiss him! [_The lantern at
    the head of the sleeping mat glows more and more brightly
    until a cat's head appears on it. At this moment a cat-call
    comes from the garden._ (NOTE.--If these effects cannot be
    gotten with no hint of the ludicrous, have the lantern glow
    with increasing light but use no cat's head or cat call.)
    _With the increase of light_, O TOYO _has begun to moan and
    toss and at the moment of the cat-call she rises as in a
    trance and goes towards the door L. As she passes the screen_
    ITO SODA _steps out from behind it and plunges his dirk into
    her back; she falls with a little, stifled cry. Instantly, in
    utter darkness, the curtain falls._]

Hageman's Make-Up Book

  By MAURICE HAGEMAN
  Price, 25 cents


The importance of an effective make-up is becoming more apparent to the
professional actor every year, but hitherto there has been no book on
the subject describing the modern methods and at the same time covering
all branches of the art. This want has now been filled. Mr. Hageman has
had an experience of twenty years as actor and stage-manager, and his
well-known literary ability has enabled him to put the knowledge so
gained into shape to be of use to others. The book is an encyclopedia of
the art of making up. Every branch of the subject is exhaustively
treated, and few questions can be asked by professional or amateur that
cannot be answered by this admirable hand-book. It is not only the best
make-up book ever published, but it is not likely to be superseded by
any other. It is absolutely indispensable to every ambitious actor.
