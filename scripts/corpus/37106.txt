              "_Go then, my little Book, and show to all
              That entertain and bid thee welcome shall,
              What thou dost keep close shut up in thy breast;
              And wish what thou dost show them may be blest
              To them for good, may make them choose to be
              Pilgrims better, by far, than thee or me.
              Tell them of Mercy; she is one
              Who early hath her pilgrimage begun.
              Yea, let young damsels learn of her to prize
              The world which is to come, and so be wise;
              For little tripping maids may follow God
              Along the ways which saintly feet have trod._"
