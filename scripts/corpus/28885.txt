be re-draped to taste
             In cloth-of-gold or camlet._

          _Here comes afresh Costumier, then;
             That Taste may gain a wrinkle
           From him who drew with such deft pen
             The rags of RIP VAN WINKLE!_

                                   _AUSTIN DOBSON._



          All in the golden afternoon
            Full leisurely we glide;
          For both our oars, with little skill,
            By little arms are plied,
          While little hands make vain pretence
            Our wanderings to guide.

          Ah, cruel Three! In such an hour,
            Beneath such dreamy weather,
          To beg a tale of breath too weak
            To stir the tiniest feather!
          Yet what can one poor voice avail
            Against three tongues together?

          Imperious Prima flashes forth
            Her edict "to begin it"--
          In gentler tone Secunda hopes
            "There will be nonsense in it!"--
          While Tertia interrupts the tale
            Not _more_ than once a minute.

          Anon, to sudden silence won,
            In fancy they pursue
          The dream-child moving through a land
            Of wonders wild and new,
          In friendly chat with bird or beast--
            And half believe it true.

          And ever, as the story drained
            The wells of fancy dry.
          And faintly strove that weary one
            To put the subject by,
          "The rest next time--" "It _is_ next time!"
            The happy voices cry.

          Thus grew the tale of Wonderland:
            Thus slowly, one by one,
          Its quaint events were hammered out--
            And now the tale is done,
          And home we steer, a merry crew,
            Beneath the setting sun.

          Alice! a childish story take,
            And with a gentle hand
          Lay it where Childhood's dreams are twined
            In Memory's mystic band,
          Like pilgrim's wither'd wreath of flowers
            Pluck'd in a far-off land.
